# MinVR3Plugin-XRIToolkit

This MinVR3 plugin adds functionality to Unity's XRI Toolkit's notion of "Contollers" and "GraphicsRaycaster" to make it easier to integrate with MinVR3 style user interfaces.  Although the cleanest option coding 3DUIs in a MinVR3 style is probably to avoid using the XRI Toolkit at all, Unity's XRI Toolkit makes things like interacting with floating UI panels easy to do.  So, if you want to mix the two paradigms, this plugin provides some functionality to help with that.
